# Boulder County Unified Records Search  
**AI Solutions Portfolio Project**  
Prepared by: *Carol Setters*  
Date: August 22, 2025  

---

## Executive Summary  
Boulder County is preparing to select a vendor to digitize decades of historic permit documents.  
This project provides the **next step after digitization**: an AI-powered enrichment and search solution that bridges vendor-delivered PDFs with Accela, making historic and live records seamlessly accessible to staff and residents.  

This project also serves as a **Minimum Remarkable Product pilot** for updating other aspects of document ingestion, storage, and retrieval in the Boulder County data ecosystem.

## 1. Project Charter  

### Vision & Scope  
Build a unified, AI-powered search system for Boulder County Community Planning & Permitting (CP&P).  
The solution will integrate digitized legacy documents with live Accela permit data, allowing staff and residents to find records quickly by address, parcel ID, or permit number.  
Scope begins after the vendor delivers digitized PDFs and metadata, and ends when enriched records are searchable via the portal.  

### Stakeholders & Roles (RACI)  
- **Accountable:** Boulder County CIO / IT Director  
- **Responsible:** Solutions Architect (design), Project Manager (execution), Vendor (digitization)  
- **Consulted:** CP&P staff, Records/Compliance, Accela product team  
- **Informed:** Residents, County Commissioners, IT leadership  

### Success Metric  
- **KPI:** 90% of record requests fulfilled in under 2 minutes via self-service search.  

---

## Data Plan  
- **Sources:** Vendor-scanned PDFs + metadata; Accela permit records (via APIs).  
- **Access:** Secure Blob Storage landing zone, Accela integration.  
- **Quality Issues:** OCR accuracy on poor scans; inconsistent address/parcel formats.  
- **Synthetic Data:** Not required; use representative archive samples.  

---

## Model Plan  
- **Rent:** Azure Document Intelligence (OCR, entity extraction).  
- **Amplify:** Enrichment pipeline for normalization, redaction, geocoding, Accela linkage.  
- **Prototype Path:** Process sample docs → validate OCR & metadata accuracy.  
- **Production Path:** Scale to all records → AI Search integration → staff/public portals.  

---

## SAT Plan (Security, Accuracy, Trust)  
- **Security:** RBAC (staff vs. public), encryption at rest/in transit, virus scans, checksums.  
- **Accuracy:** Confidence thresholds; low-confidence OCR → manual review.  
- **Trust & Transparency:** Public sees redacted copies; staff see originals; audit logs.  

---

## Risks & Assumptions  

**Risks:**  
- Poor scan quality reduces OCR accuracy.  
- Timeline extension from testing setbacks.  
- Linking errors between legacy docs and Accela permits.  
- Budget overruns if storage grows quickly.  

**Assumptions:**  
- Vendor delivers legible PDFs + metadata.  
- Accela APIs stable and available.  
- Staff adoption supported with training & change management.  

---

## Timeline  
- **Pilot Batch (Month 1–2):** Small set processed, measure query response, find bottlenecks.  
- **Scaling Phase (Month 3–4):** Expand batch size, track enrichment/indexing performance.  
- **Optimization (Month 4):** Fix scan quality, enrichment latency, API issues.  
- **Final Validation (Month 5):** Confirm sustained KPI compliance, close project.

## Communication Strategy  

### Clarity of Challenge + Metric  
- Service metric: 90% of requests in < 2 minutes.  
- Stakeholder metric: Confidence, survey feedback, participation, willingness to expand AI.  

### Realism of Data + Model Plan  
- Prototype-first → validate OCR + enrichment on a pilot set.  
- Iterative scale → expand before full ingestion.  
- Transparency → highlight scan/API risks, avoid overpromising.  

### Strength of SAT Design  
- **Security:** Staff/public access separation, virus scans.  
- **Accuracy:** Confidence thresholds + manual review.  
- **Trust:** Public = redacted docs; staff = originals; audit trails logged.  

### Monitoring Plan + Benchmarks  
- **Weekly dashboards:** Vendor quality, enrichment accuracy, % docs linked to Accela.  
- **Monthly reviews:** Accuracy rates, adoption, staff feedback.  
- **Early warnings:** Flag vendor scan issues before scaling.  

### Cadence + Completeness  
- Weekly updates: IT + CP&P.  
- Monthly briefings: Commissioners.  
- Quarterly public reports.  
- Chat interface: GitHub Repo chatbot to query progress.  

### Depth of Empathy  
- **Staff:** Fewer bottlenecks, easier access.  
- **Residents:** Transparency, faster service, self-service.  
- **Leadership:** ROI from vendor investment, activated by AI enrichment.

## Bottom Line  
This project ensures Boulder County enriches vendor-delivered PDFs and integrates them into Accela in a pilot that improves storage and retrieval, demonstrating future opportunities for public and staff-facing data solutions.
